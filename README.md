# Betrayal Board Game
Betrayal is a board game where you explore a haunted mansion. The game allows players to build their own haunted house room by room. Each turn players can explore a new room, which adds a new random tile. This way the mansion is random every time you play. You can play as one of 6 characters each with his own strengths and weaknesses. Each character has 4 attributes Speed, Sanity, Might, and Knowledge.
Game play starts with everybody cooperating, exploring and collecting items. At some point in the game one player betrays the rest. After that everybody else needs to work together to defeat the traitor before itâ€™s too late.

# Overview of Betrayal Character Stats app
The purpose of BetrayalCharacterStats is to keep track of player stats in the "Betrayal at House on The Hill" board game.  I built it using Android Studio and Java. 

I created the app because it is very easy to accidentally shift the tabs that keep track of the player stats.

The app keeps track of stats by positioning 4 pin images on top of a character image. You can change stats by touching and sliding pins up and down. The app stores all stats locally on the phone. The user can reset stats for individual characters or for the whole app. The app also allows users to rearrange characters, to allow multiple players to keep track of their stats one a single device. 
The app supports casting to Chromecast. Chromecast is an easy way to add smart TV functionality to any TV. I decided to integrate Chromecast since all player stats in the game are supposed to be visible to everybody. All players can cast to a single TV where each character shows the name and stats of each player.

## Technical Architecture 
The app is written using Android Studio and the Android SDK.

The app uses the SharedPreferences API to store data. This allows apps to store simple key-value pairs. Since the app needs to store only 4 values for each character, this mechanism of storing data is more than enough.
I'm using drag-sort-listview https://github.com/bauerca/drag-sort-listview. This provided an easy way to create a list that allows you to drag items up and down to rearrange.

The source is separated in several sections. The Data namespace holds data objects such as the Stats, Settings, as well as the Provider classes responsible for instantiating data objects, and getting stored data or defaults. 

The Helpers namespace has several classes that encapsulate functionality. The CastChannel and CastOptionsProvider are part of the Chromecast implementation. The CastChannel mainly provides the namespace required to communicate with the Cast app. The options privier has the Chromecast App Id which is a random alphanumeric id used to tell Chromecast which app to load. 
The ImageLoaderTask offloads the image loading to a separate thread. This helps the application to be more responsive and have less lag spikes due to resource loading.

The App has a single Activity which is responsible for managing the main menu and loading either the CharacterViewPagerFragment or the ReorderCharsFragment. The first one is a carousel of character cards. This is the main screen where characters and their stats are shown. You can swipe left and right between all the characters. The second fragment is responsible for reordering the characters. It implements drag-sort-listview which gives users the ability to reorder and remove characters. 

## Setup Instructions + 
To compile and run the app you need Android Studio https://developer.android.com/studio/. After downloading and installing Android Studio it will ask you to download the necessary portions of Android SDK.

To open the app, select the "Open an existing project" option and navigate to the folder where you downloaded the source code.

Android Studio will ask you where you want to run the app. Select the phone you have connected, or alternatively you can create a virtual device to run and test your apps.

## App Walkthrough
Using the app is simple, when the app starts you are presented with the first character card, you can swipe left and right to view all characters, each character is double sided so you can flip the current card to view the other side by going to the 3 dots menu and selecting the "Flip Current Character". Each character card also has a pull up drawer that has more information about the character as well as one time stats increases when a player ends their turn in a specific room.

The side menu shows all characters, allows you to flip any of them or to jump to any character on the list. From there you can also set the always-on display option, turn vibrate on and off (phone vibrates when you change stats), set the player name that appears when you cast your character, and reset all stats for all characters.

Finally, you can change the character order from the Re-Order Characters screen. You can drag characters up and down to rearrange them or swipe them away to remove them from the list. This allows multiple players to use a single device. The reset option resets both the order and add all removed characters. The reset all options in the side menu also resets the character order.
