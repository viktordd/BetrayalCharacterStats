# Betrayal Board Game
Betrayal is a board game where you explore a haunted mansion. The game allows players to build their own haunted house room by room. Each turn players can explore a new room, which adds a new random tile. This way the mansion is random every time you play. You can play as one of 6 characters each with his own strengths and weaknesses. Each character has 4 attributes Speed, Sanity, Might, and Knowledge.
Game play starts with everybody cooperating, exploring and collecting items. At some point in the game one player betrays the rest. After that everybody else needs to work together to defeat the traitor before itâ€™s too late.

# Overview of Betrayal Character Stats app
The purpose of BetrayalCharacterStats is to keep track of player stats in the "Betrayal at House on The Hill" board game.  I built it using Android Studio and Java. 

I created the app because it is very easy to accidentally shift the tabs that keep track of the player stats.

The app keeps track of stats by positioning 4 pin images on top of a character image. You can change stats by touching and sliding pins up and down. The app stores all stats locally on the phone. The user can reset stats for individual characters or for the whole app. The app also allows users to rearrange characters, to allow multiple players to keep track of their stats one a single device. 
The app supports casting to Chromecast. Chromecast is an easy way to add smart TV functionality to any TV. I decided to integrate Chromecast since all player stats in the game are supposed to be visible to everybody. All players can cast to a single TV where each character shows the name and stats of each player.

## Technical Architecture 
The app is written using Android Studio and the Android SDK.

The app uses the SharedPreferences API to store data. This allows apps to store simple key-value pairs. Since the app needs to store only 4 values for each character, this mechanism of storing data is more than enough.
I'm using drag-sort-listview https://github.com/bauerca/drag-sort-listview. This provided an easy way to create a list that allows you to drag items up and down to rearrange.

The source is separated in several sections. The Data namespace holds data objects such as the Stats, Settings, as well as the Provider classes responsible for instantiating data objects, and getting stored data or defaults. 

The Helpers namespace has several classes that encapsulate functionality. The CastChannel and CastOptionsProvider are part of the Chromecast implementation. The CastChannel mainly provides the namespace required to communicate with the Cast app. The options privier has the Chromecast App Id which is a random alphanumeric id used to tell Chromecast which app to load. 
The ImageLoaderTask offloads the image loading to a separate thread. This helps the application to be more responsive and have less lag spikes due to resource loading.

The App has a single Activity which is responsible for managing the main menu and loading either the CharacterViewPagerFragment or the ReorderCharsFragment. The first one is a carousel of character cards. This is the main screen where characters and their stats are shown. You can swipe left and right between all the characters. The second fragment is responsible for reordering the characters. It implements drag-sort-listview which gives users the ability to reorder and remove characters. 

## Setup Instructions + 
To compile and run the app you need Android Studio https://developer.android.com/studio/. After downloading and installing Android Studio it will ask you to download the necessary portions of Android SDK.
